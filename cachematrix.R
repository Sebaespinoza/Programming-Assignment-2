## First, should see README.md 

## This file will include two functions:
## 1. makeCacheMatrix()
## 2. cacheSolve()

## The function makeCacheMatrix creates a "matrix" which also can cache its inverse.
## This function contains the following functions:

# set          set the value of a matrix
# get          get the value of a matrix
# setinver     set the cached value from the inverse of the matrix.
# getinver     get the cached value from the inverse of the matrix.
